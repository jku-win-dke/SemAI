        "- It is not strictly necessary to draw a box around each named graph, as seen in the slides. The different named graphs should simply be visually distinguishable and not overlap.\n",
        "- If not all nodes within a named graph are connected, make sure in the visualization that the named graph still forms a coherent visual unit in some way."
